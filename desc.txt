Assignment #5       NO LATE ASSIGNMENTS ACCEPTED PLEASE.     

DUE 11 p.m.  

Write a program to implement Huffman coding and decoding (see pages 415-421) in Java.

The program's input will be a command line file that can contain any char, but the 
only ones of interest in this assignment are the capital letters A through G.
A COMMAND LINE FILE IS JUST THAT: A FILE NAME THAT IS ENTERED ON THE COMMAND
LINE (you will use jGrasp with build/run args) PRIOR TO RUNNING THE PROGRAM.
Read the file char by char.
IF the file happens to contain chars other than A through G IGNORE THEM in a-d.
Spaces should be ignored , for example , as should other chars!
You may assume that each of A through G are in the file.

I want you to display (all answers MUST  go to 
the console) using a menu system (from the console OR from a window) :

  a.  The Huffman tree (see page 405 and 418 )itself (you may use the code from Tree.java if you wish.)
      You may assume that the tree will turn out to be no deeper than the tree shown on page 405.
      You may also assume that no individual char appears more than 9 times.
      Print either a char or a weight depending upon whether the node is a leaf or not.
      The Huffman tree can be constructed using a priority queue.
      Exercise OPTION a before other options.

  b.  the code table that displays the encoding for each of the chars A through G (see page 
      416-417.) EXERCISE  OPTION b after OPTION a. 

  c.  the binary encoding of the portion of the file
      that only contains the chars A through G (after each eight bits leave a space and print only 3 bytes per line.)
      The binary encoding may not necessarily display a "full" byte at the end (see page 417.) Exercise 
      OPTION c after OPTION b

 d.  the A-G portion of the original file that is calculated by using the HUFFMAN TREE  from
     part a and the binary encoding from part c (don't just print the file back from the original; you
     must use the HUFFMAN TREE to do this.)  So you want to "read" the binary encoding from part c (using the 
     HUFFMAN TREE from part a to reconstruct the portion of the file that consists of A through G.)  BASICALLY
     YOU ARE DEOCODING THE PORTION OF THE FILE THAT CONSISTS OF THE CHARS A-G.  AS YOU READ THE ENCODED FILE
     YOU ARE  MARCHING DOWN THE HUFFMAN TREE--WHEN YOU REACH A LEAF, YOU CAN FIGURE OUT WHICH CHAR IT IS AND
     YOU PRINT THAT CHAR. Exercise OPTION d after OPTION c.


                  
Same rules as other programs. I will use jGrasp. One file only. Name it correctly.

I hope you enjoy this. It is an important task.

Best regards,
